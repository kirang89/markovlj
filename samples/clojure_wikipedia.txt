Rich Hickey is the creator of the Clojure programming language. Before Clojure,
he developed dotLisp, a similar project based on the .NET platform. He also
developed jfli (a Java foreign language interface for Common Lisp), FOIL (a
Foreign Object Interface for Lisp) and Lisplets (a Lisp-friendly interface to
Java Servlets). Those three were earlier attempts to provide interoperability
between Lisp and Java.

Hickey spent about 2Â½ years working on Clojure before publicly releasing it,
much of that time working exclusively on Clojure without external funding. At
the end of this period Hickey sent an email announcing the language to some
friends in the Common Lisp community.

The development process is community-driven and the development is managed at
the Clojure Community website. The website contains planning documents and an
issue tracker where bugs may be filed. General development discussion takes
place at the Clojure Dev Google Group. While anyone can submit bug reports and
ideas, to contribute patches one must sign the Clojure Contributor
agreement, JIRA tickets are processed by a team of screeners and finally
Rich Hickey approves the changes
